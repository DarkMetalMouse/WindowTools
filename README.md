# WindowTools
Some tools I made to help me manage my workflow on Windows.
All files (except [SwitchDisplays](https://github.com/DarkMetalMouse/WindowTools/blob/master/SwitchDisplays.pyw)) are run on startup. They are .pyw files so they don't launch a terminal window.
These programs are mapped to F keys above 12, I remapped my numpad to these keys using my keyboard's software (iCUE)

## [MouseAngleControl](https://github.com/DarkMetalMouse/WindowTools/blob/master/MouseAngleControl.pyw)
Accurately move the curser with a certain angle controlled by a GUI.
I have the angle control keys bound to the volume scroller of my keyboard.

## [ResizeFromCenter](https://github.com/DarkMetalMouse/WindowTools/blob/master/ResizeFromCenter.pyw)
Resize a window from it's center when pressing the ctrl button, similar ctrl resize in PowerPoint.

## [SwitchDisplays](https://github.com/DarkMetalMouse/WindowTools/blob/master/SwitchDisplays.pyw)
When launched, the program will switch every opened window from one monitor to the other, resizing them if necessary.
I have this script bound to a macro in [WindowToolsHotkeys](https://github.com/DarkMetalMouse/WindowTools/blob/master/WindowToolsHotkeys.ahk)

## [WindowToolsHotkeys](https://github.com/DarkMetalMouse/WindowTools/blob/master/WindowToolsHotkeys.ahk)
Some macros I use, notably the 2nd one, which allows me to rotate the screen with a press of a button.
